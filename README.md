# bitcoin_prediction_capstone
This project uses advanced forecasting techniques and algorithms to create a bitcoin stock price prediction mechanism with flexible window and horizon values

horizon = number of timesteps to predict into future
window = number of timesteps from past used to predict horizon

**Models**
1) NaÃ¯ve model (baseline)
2) Dense model
3) Conv1D
4) LSTM 
5) Similar model but with multivariate data - Block reward size
6) **N-BEATs Algorithm**
7) Ensemble (multiple models optimized on different loss functions)
8) Future prediction model (model to predict future values)
9) Same as 1 (but with turkey ðŸ¦ƒ data introduced)
